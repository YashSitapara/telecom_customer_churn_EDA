# Overview

This analysis focuses on understanding customer churn in a telecommunications dataset. The dataset contains 7,043 records with 21 features, including customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and billing information. The goal was to explore patterns and key factors influencing customer churn.

# Key Findings

## Churn Rate
- **26.54%** of customers churned, while **73.46%** remained active.
- This indicates a significant portion of customers discontinue services, highlighting potential areas for retention strategies.

## Data Preprocessing
- The `TotalCharges` column was converted from string to float after handling missing values (replaced with 0).
- The `SeniorCitizen` column was transformed into a categorical variable ("yes"/"no").

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Average Tenure**: ~32 months.
- **Average Monthly Charges**: ~$64.
- **No Duplicates**: The dataset had no duplicate customer IDs or records.

## Visualizations
- **Churn Distribution**: A countplot and pie chart illustrated the imbalance between churned and retained customers.

### Key Insights:
- 26.54% churn rate suggests a need for proactive retention strategies.
- The dataset was clean, with no missing values after preprocessing.

# Recommendations

## Retention Strategies
- Target high-risk customer segments (e.g., month-to-month contracts, high monthly charges).
- Offer incentives for long-term contracts to reduce churn.

## Further Analysis
- Investigate the relationship between churn and features like `Contract`, `InternetService`, and `PaymentMethod`.
- Use predictive modeling (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to identify at-risk customers.

# Conclusion

The analysis successfully identified key trends in customer churn, with 26.54% of customers leaving, emphasizing the need for targeted retention efforts. The visualizations provided clear insights, and further modeling could enhance predictive capabilities for reducing churn.

# Next Steps

- Conduct deeper feature analysis.
- Implement machine learning models for churn prediction.
- Develop customer retention programs based on insights.
