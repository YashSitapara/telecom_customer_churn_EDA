# Customer Churn Analysis

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing customer churn in a telecommunications dataset.  
The main goal is to prepare data, explore key features, and build predictive models to understand and reduce customer churn.

## 📚 Project Overview

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, convert datatypes, and prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize churn distribution, customer demographics, and service usage patterns.
- **Reporting**: Summarize findings and propose actionable insights for customer retention.
